## Decimal to Hexadecimal Converter in Alfred(0.0)

#### Motivation:
	I took an Operating System course last semester. In this course, I had to do a lot of conversion between 
	decimal numbers and hexadecimal nunmbers(mostly because of memory stuff). I used Windows 10 before, where 
	the system contains a calculator with "programming" mode, under which I can just type in a number in 
	decimal. And then the hex number will just show up there.
	
	It took me quite a while to figure out how to get into Mac's programmer-mode calculator. And I think it 
	would still be nice to have an easy and fast way to do the conversion.
	
	Thus I wrote this Alfred workflow.

#### src:
	This folder contains the python script used in this project as well as the logo icon from Internet.

#### Decimal to Hexadecimal Converter:
	This is the workflow file. To use this workflow,
	just download this file and open it with Alfred.
