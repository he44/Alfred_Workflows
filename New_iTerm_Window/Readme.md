## New iTerm Window(0.0)

#### Motivation:
	I used a mac and traveled between different desktops a lot. Although I tried to keep my coding work in one or two desktops, I still found myself trying to open a new iTerm window in other desktops a lot.

	Previously I would just type "iTerm" in Alfred. But this will bring me to the other desktop where I already have iTerm open. And I have to open a new iTerm window there, then drag it back to the current desktop. I think this is terribly inconvenient.

	Thus I decided to write this Alfred workflow.

###### src:
	This folder contains the Apple Script used in this project as well as the logo image.

###### iTerm Window:
	This is the workflow file. You can just download this and add it to your Alfred workflow.

###### Usage:
	1. open Alfred with your key combo

	2. type "ct"

	3. Hit Enter

###### Possible Improvement:
	If you are in a desktop with another iTerm window already existing, this command with bring all those windows to the front. This can be inconveninet some time, but I have not figured out a solution yet.  

###### Reference:

1.	I learned that Apple Script can be integrated with Alfred through this workflow I found online and used every day:

2.	I learned how to find possible apple script commands for each program from this website:

3.	I took a screenshot of an image I found on the following website to get the logo:
